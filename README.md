# CODSOFT-TASK--1

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about various credit card transactions, and models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees are used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Import Libraries
Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## Load the Dataset
Load the training and the testing dataset from a CSV file.

## Data Cleaning
Remove irrelevant columns and select a subset of the data for initial analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, check for null values, data types, and visualize the distribution of fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Also, visualize the correlation matrix.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables, splitting the features and target variable, and ensuring the test data matches the training data format.

## Model Training and Evaluation
## Logistic Regression
Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data and make predictions on the test data.

## Decision Tree
Train a Decision Tree model on the training data and make predictions on the test data.

## Evaluation Metrics
Calculate and store the evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1 Score) for both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.

## Plotting Metrics
Plot the evaluation metrics for both models to visually compare their performance.

## Confusion Matrix
Generate and plot confusion matrices for both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to understand the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## ROC Curve and AUC
Compute and plot the ROC curves and AUC for both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to evaluate their performance in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
